# cellular-potts-model

`author: Ali Hashmi`

A mathematica implementation of the cellular-potts model. The code currently includes constraints for cell volume, perimeter and cell-cell adhesion.


To possibly include: 
`connectivity constraint`
`preferred direction for migration`
`periodic boundary condition`
`integrate PDEs over the mesh`
