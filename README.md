# cellular-potts-model

`author: Ali Hashmi`

A toy implementation of the cellular-potts model in mathematica. The code currently includes constraints for cell volume, perimeter and cell-cell adhesion.


To possibly include in future: 
`connectivity constraint`
`torus boundary condition`
`integrate PDEs over the mesh`
